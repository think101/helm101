for the guestbook example, it turns out the master/slave and leader/follower terminology is not consist with the latest bitnami/redis (v17.0.1) image and guestbook (v5) image, after install the charts the message can not be persisted to the redis backend, and on the page the input message is not printed out after click submit.

the workaround is to set up leader/follower deployment and service, and put these yaml files into the templates directory, then this example can work well
